# Scanning-with-nmap
🛰️ Nmap Scanning 

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful tool used to scan networks and systems to discover open ports, running services, and exposed entry points.

What it is:
A network reconnaissance tool that maps how a target system is reachable and what services it is offering.

Why it’s important:

Reveals security weaknesses

Helps administrators secure systems

Identifies unnecessary or misconfigured services

Forms the foundation of network security assessments

Why hackers use it:

To recon before an attack

To find open doors (ports/services)

To understand the attack surface

To choose the right exploit



No scan = no awareness. Nmap turns the unknown into known.
